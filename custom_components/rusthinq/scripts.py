"""rusthinq-scripts (the Rhai drivers) in `<config>/rusthinq/scripts`: which commit is there and how the pinned one
gets in.

The integration pins one dated rusthinq-scripts release (`RELEASE`, by its commit `COMMIT`), so drivers change only with
an integration release. A start whose installed commit differs from the pin installs the pinned one.

A GitHub tarball carries its commit in `VERSION` (`export-subst`: `<sha> <date>`). The daemon watches the directory it
canonicalized at start (`driver_watch.rs`, inotify, recursive), so an update changes files inside `scripts/` (each
replaced atomically, removed ones deleted), as a `git pull` would, and the daemon reloads the drivers by itself;
replacing the directory itself would leave the daemon watching the old one. The first install, with no daemon running,
moves the unpacked tree in whole.
